# Student Volunteers

The Organising Committee calls for students who are interested in volunteering for CUI 2021. Tasks may include but are not limited to: offering technical support during online sessions, reviewing and facilitating questions from the audience to the presenters, supporting the setup of break out rooms, as well as welcoming attendees or helping with the setup of the social event.

Selected students will be expected to put in approx. 3 hours of work during the conference. In exchange, their conference fee will be waived and they will receive a certificate for their contribution.

We will prioritize student volunteer applications from candidates who can demonstrate financial hardship due to their current economic situation.

To apply, please send an email to the [CUI 2021 SV chair](mailto:cui2021-svdiversity@conversationaluserinterfaces.org "CUI 2021 SV Chair"), shortly outlining your background/circumstances and respective motivation for being involved.
