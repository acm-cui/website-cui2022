I"±<p>CUI 2021 strives to be an inclusive and accessible conference and we will do our best to accommodate requests for special assistance. Information will be posted here as we develop our plans for the conference, to help you make an informed decision about whether the conference will be accessible to you. Please contact us if your question is not answered here, or if the conference arrangements as described are not enough to allow you to attend. We will work with you to the best of our ability, to make the conference accessible.</p>

<p>The SV and Diversity Chair and Virtual Chairs are progressively assembling this information. If you have questions or wish to raise a point regarding our efforts to ensure all attendees can participate, please contact the SV and Diversity Chairs directly by emailing: <a href="mailto:cui2021-svdiversity@conversationaluserinterfaces.org">cui2021-svdiversity@conversationaluserinterfaces.org</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-communicate-accessibility-needs-to-organizers">How do I communicate accessibility needs to organizers?</h2>

<p>The SV and Diversity Chair, Jaisie Sin, has a goal of ensuring the conference is accessible to everyone. When you register for the conference, there will be a question labelled ‚ÄúDo you have any specific access requirements?‚Äù. Please complete this question to indicate anything that will help make the conference accessible to you. Possible requests include but are not limited to: sign language interpretation, note taker, assistive listening device, captioning, description (for slides, overheads or videos), pre-conference orientation tour of the virtual conference interface, and keyboard-only navigation options. The SV and Diversity Chairs will follow up with requests. You can contact them directly at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:cui2021-svdiversity@conversationaluserinterfaces.org">cui2021-svdiversity@conversationaluserinterfaces.org</a>.</p>

<p>Please be aware that some accommodations may be difficult to provide at short notice, and we may not be able to accommodate every request.</p>

<h2 id="will-sign-language-interpretation-be-available">Will sign language interpretation be available?</h2>

<p>If you request sign language interpretation in your conference registration, we will strive to provide interpretation for all conference presentations and events, including informal conversations. Please register your request before Friday, June 25th. The SV and Diversity Chairs will follow up with you and connect you to interpreters and make arrangements for the streams. After that point, we will do our best to accommodate the needs.</p>

<p>You may also bring your own interpreter to the event. Please reach out to the SV and Diversity Chairs to set this up.</p>

<h2 id="will-captions-be-available">Will captions be available?</h2>
