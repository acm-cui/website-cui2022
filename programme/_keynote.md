# Conference keynote

We are delighted to announce that Prof. Dr. Elisabeth André from Augsburg University will be the keynote speaker for {{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }}.

## Socially-Aware Conversational Interfaces: Challenges and Perspectives

Social interactions shape our human life and are inherently emotional. Human conversational partners usually try to interpret (consciously or unconsciously) the speaker's or listener's socio-affective cues and respond to them accordingly. With the objective to contribute to more natural and intuitive ways of communicating with machines, an increasing number of research projects has started to investigate how to simulate similar behaviors in socially-interactive agents. In my talk, I will present an overview of the state of the art in socially-interactive agents that expose a socially-aware interface including mechanisms to recognize a user's socio-affective state, to respond to it appropriately and to continuously learn how to adapt to the needs and preferences of a human user. To this end, I will focus on three essential properties of socially-aware interfaces: Social Perception, Socially-Aware Behavior Synthesis, and Learning Socially-Aware Behaviors. I will also analyze the limitations of current approaches and discuss directions for future development.
