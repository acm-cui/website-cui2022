## CUIs as Entertainers 
_Organisers: Justin Edwards, Leigh Clark, Matthew Aylett, Allison Perrone_

This SIG will feature practical demonstrations of tools that allow us to use CUIs as entertainers such as large language models like GPT-3, Hidden Markov Models like those used by Botnik's Voicebox keyboards, and the voice puppetry technology made by CereProc. This event will introduce these tools to participants and give everyone a chance to play around with them on their own, showcasing the creative and entertaining outputs they leverage from CUIs.
