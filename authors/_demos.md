		<h2>Curated selection process</h2>

			All submissions will be reviewed by at least one chair and one external reviewer.  In curating the program creativity in delivery, feasibility, novelty, and ability to engage online attendees will be assessed. Our aim is to deliver an array of captivating demonstrations that showcase the diverse research arenas contributing to the conversational user interface research community. Sensitive, private and/or proprietary information should not be disclosed prior to publication. Business exposure is reserved for event sponsors only, so advertising materials should not be used in demonstrations.
