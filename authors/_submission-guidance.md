# Submission guidance

This page should explain the entire submission process through to publication. Please contact the [{{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles'][page.responsible_chairs]['label'] }}]({{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles'][page.responsible_chairs]['email'] }} "Email the {{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }} {{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles'][page.responsible_chairs]['label'] }}") if you have questions not answered here.

## Word limits

{{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }} has switched from page limits to <em>approximate</em> word limits. The word limits are somewhat relaxed but note that papers which substantially exceed these limits may be rejected. Papers substantially under the word limit may not present a sufficient contribution for inclusion in the {{ site.conference.short_name }} proceedings. In summary, **we ask authors to stick to the spirit of word limits.**

## Submission process

All submissions of original work (i.e., all tracks but *Featured Talks*) must be made by the conference submission system. Track chairs will assign three reviewers to each submission, and reviewers will anonymously review the submission. Each track has a different emphasis that reviewers will be asked to consider. For example, submissions to the [Full Papers track](/2021/authors/full-papers "The {{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }} Full Papers track") must demonstrate a novel contribution, submissions to the [Provocation Papers track](/2021/authors/provication-papers "The {{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }} Provication Papers track") must have the capacity to spark a debate, and so on. Following the three reviews being submitted, the track chairs will make a decision whether to accept or reject the submission.

This year we have introduced rebuttals for the [Full Papers](/2021/authors/full-papers/ "The {{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }} Full Papers track") track, allowing authors to respond to the reviewers before a final decision is made on submissions by the Full Papers Chairs. Rebuttals will be made through the conference submission system as a text-only response to the reviewers. Rebuttals can include promises to make changes to the paper, as well as to respond to points the authors disagree with. Reviewers will be given the opportunity to revise their review for this track, after which the Full Papers Chairs will make the final decision.

At this point, all acceptances will be conditional on any changes requested by the track chairs being made to the paper. All tracks include a camera-ready period where authors can make these very minor changes to their paper, in line with the reviews.  Authors should make these requested changes and submit the revised paper to the conference submission system. Some papers may be "shepherded", whereby the track chairs will work with authors to oversee changes to the paper requested if these are considered more than "very minor". Papers may be rejected if it is felt authors have not made sufficient effort to revise their paper as expected.

Following this process, authors will receive details from the {{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles'][page.responsible_chairs]['label'] }} in how to get their paper ready for publication, including completing the rights review process.

## Accessibility

We ask all authors to prepare **an accessible submission** by marking up their documents with correct styles and features including tables and equations, setting text descriptions for all figures, not relying on colour to distinguish elements. The [CHI 2021 Guide to an Accessible Submission](https://chi2021.acm.org/for-authors/presenting/papers/guide-to-an-accessible-submission "Read the CHI 2021 Guide to an Accessible Submission") should be followed as closely as possible, and provides useful instructions for doing this.

**Papers will not be published if they do not adhere to these accessibility guidelines**. Authors are expected to have ensured their paper is accessible by the camera-ready deadline at the very latest. The publishing process takes some time and we have little opportunity to delay it. All papers must be readied before we can proceed with publication. If in doubt, speak to the [{{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles'][page.responsible_chairs]['label'] }}]({{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles'][page.responsible_chairs]['email'] }} "Email the {{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }} {{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles'][page.responsible_chairs]['label'] }}").

## Policies on submission

By submitting to the conference, you are agreeing to the following:
* You must anonymise your submission (The [CHI Anonymization Policy](https://chi2021.acm.org/for-authors/presenting/papers/chi-anonymization-policy "Read the CHI conference policy on Anonymisation") provides useful pointers to help make sure your submission is anonymous)
* You must use [ACM’s in-text citation style and reference formats](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/reference-formatting "Read the ACM policy on Citation Style and Reference Formats")
* Submissions found not adhere to [ACM’s policies on plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview "Read the ACM policy on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification") will be rejected   
* Authors and reviewers will be asked to indicate their understanding and acceptance of the [ACM Policy on Conflict of Interest in Publication](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest "Read the Conflict of Interest Policy for ACM Publications") when items are submitted and reviewed
* Papers submitted to the conference [cannot be under consideration for any other conference or publication and cannot be previously published without undergoing substantial revision](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions "Read the ACM policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous")

Any authors found to be in violation of any of these policies may have any/all submissions desk rejected.

## Publication

Articles will be published in the {{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }} proceedings, through [ACM ICPS](https://www.acm.org/publications/icps-series "Details about the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series"). At least one author of each paper must register for the conference by the camera-ready deadline to ensure publication. 

Given the switch to an online conferene, we are currently reviewing how registration and publication fees will be handled.

All ACM publications follow the [Green Open Access route by default](https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess#green "Details on ACM's Green Open Access policies"), although authors have the opportunity to independently pay a fee for [Gold Open Access](https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess#oapricing "Details on Gold Open Access pricing for ACM publications"). The total fee payable depends on the author(s) ACM membership status.
