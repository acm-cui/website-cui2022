      There has been an increasing interest in language-based interactions with technology. Driven by the commercial success of intelligent personal assistant devices such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, the number of natural language and conversation-based interactions is growing in commercial settings. Following the successful inaugural ACM In-Cooperation conference in 2019 and the virtual conferences in 2020 and 2021, CUI 2022 aims to further develop a collaborative community around human-computer interaction issues in speech and language technology, with a specific interest in theory-based and applied scientific issues in the field of speech and text-based conversational user interfaces. Thus CUI 2022 further looks to bring together relevant communities (e.g., ISCA, ACM SIGCHI, CogSci, CHIIR), to publish, disseminate and showcase high-quality cutting-edge research related to the field, promote insight and debate in this exciting and essential discipline within language interfaces.
