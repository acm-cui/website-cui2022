# Camera-ready guidance

Congratulations on your accepted paper for {{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }}. This page outlines what you need to do to prepare your paper for inclusion in the {{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }} proceedings, due to be published in the [ACM Digital Library](http://dl.acm.org/ "The ACM Digital Library"").

The publishing process takes some time and we have little opportunity to delay it. All papers must be readied before we can proceed with publication. If in doubt, speak to the [{{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles'][page.responsible_chairs]['label'] }}]({{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles'][page.responsible_chairs]['email'] }} "Email the {{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }} {{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles'][page.responsible_chairs]['label'] }}").

## 1. Revise your paper in response to the reviews

Please incorporate the requested changes made in your reviews. Papers which do not do this may still be rejected—all acceptances are conditional on the requested changes being incorporated by authors and the paper passing a final review by the track chairs.

## 2. Add the ACM Computing Classification and keywords

You must categorise your paper according to the [2012 ACM Computing Classification System (CCS)](https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012 "ACM 2012 CCS website"]. ACM provide an [online tool](https://dl.acm.org/ccs "ACM CCS generator") to generate the correct markup for your document. You must also include a least a few suitable keywords for your paper.

## 3. Ensure your paper is accessible for all

Authors must ensure their paper is accessible for all, by marking up their documents with correct styles and features including tables and equations, setting text descriptions for all figures, and not relying on colour to distinguish elements. Authors should follow the [CHI 2021 Guide to an Accessible Submission](https://chi2021.acm.org/for-authors/presenting/papers/guide-to-an-accessible-submission "Read the CHI 2021 Guide to an Accessible Submission") as closely as possible in preparing their paper for publication. **Papers will not be published if they do not adhere to these accessibility guidelines**.  Authors are expected to have ensured their paper is accessible by the camera-ready deadline at the very latest. 

## 4. Complete rights review process

You will receive an email from _rightsreview@acm.org_. You will need to complete this so that we can assign all rights for the conference proceedings.

All ACM publications follow the [Green Open Access route by default](https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess#green "Details on ACM's Green Open Access policies"), although authors have the opportunity to independently pay a fee for [Gold Open Access](https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess#oapricing "Details on Gold Open Access pricing for ACM publications"). The total fee payable depends on the author(s) ACM membership status.


## 5a. Ensure you only use accepted LaTeX packages <span class="badge badge-secondary">LaTeX users only</span>

The generation of the {{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }} proceedings is automated (i.e., you supply the source LaTeX files and the final outputs are automatically compiled from these sources). Authors who prepared their paper in LaTeX must make sure any packages they use are included in this [list of accepted LaTeX packages]( https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/accepted-latex-packages "The ACM Publishing System (TAPS)"). We recommend ensuring you check your LaTeX source as soon as possible.

## 5b. Apply the ACM Master Article template <span class="badge badge-secondary">Microsoft Word users only</span>

The generation of the {{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }} proceedings is automated (i.e., you supply the source Word file and the final outputs are automatically compiled from this document). Authors who prepared their paper in Microsoft Word must apply the ACM Master Article Template to their document. Information on how to do this is available  in [this PDF](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_master_article_template_instructions.pdf "Instructions for Applying the Master Article Template to your Accepted ACM Submission Document").

## 6. Upload the final document source code to TAPS

After completing the rights process, you will receive an email directing you to upload your source code to The ACM Production System (TAPS). TAPS is an automated system that takes document sources and handles the generation of output HTML and PDFs automatically. You will need to review and approve the generated output. 

Information on using TAPS can be found in [this PDF](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_taps.pdf "Instructions for Submitting the Author’s Paper/Article to The ACM Publishing System"). Questions regarding the ACM authoring templates MUST be referred to the ACM TeX support team at [acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com](mailto:acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com "ACM TeX support") and not the {{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles'][page.responsible_chairs]['label'] }}.

## 7. Sit back and relax (and prepare your talk/demo)

Success! The {{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles'][page.responsible_chairs]['label'] }} will be in touch regarding presentation timings in due course.
