# Accessibility

{{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year}} strives to be an inclusive and accessible conference and we will do our best to accommodate requests for special assistance. Information will be posted here as we develop our plans for the conference, to help you make an informed decision about whether the conference will be accessible to you. Please contact us if your question is not answered here, or if the conference arrangements as described are not enough to allow you to attend. We will work with you to the best of our ability, to make the conference accessible.

The {{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles']['sv_diversity']['label'] }} and {{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles']['virtual']['label'] }} are progressively assembling this information. If you have questions or wish to raise a point regarding our efforts to ensure all attendees can participate, please contact the SV and Diversity Chairs directly by emailing: <a href="mailto:cui2021-svdiversity@conversationaluserinterfaces.org">cui2021-svdiversity@conversationaluserinterfaces.org</a>.

## How do I communicate accessibility needs to organizers?

The SV and Diversity Chair, Jaisie Sin, has a goal of ensuring the conference is accessible to everyone. When you register for the conference, there will be a question labelled "Do you have any specific access requirements?". Please complete this question to indicate anything that will help make the conference accessible to you. Possible requests include but are not limited to: sign language interpretation, note taker, assistive listening device, captioning, description (for slides, overheads or videos), pre-conference orientation tour of the virtual conference interface, and keyboard-only navigation options. The SV and Diversity Chairs will follow up with requests. You can contact them directly at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:cui2021-svdiversity@conversationaluserinterfaces.org">cui2021-svdiversity@conversationaluserinterfaces.org</a>.

Please be aware that some accommodations may be difficult to provide at short notice, and we may not be able to accommodate every request.

## Will sign language interpretation be available?

If you request sign language interpretation in your conference registration, we will strive to provide interpretation for all conference presentations and events, including informal conversations. Please register your request before Friday, June 25th. The SV and Diversity Chairs will follow up with you and connect you to interpreters and make arrangements for the streams. After that point, we will do our best to accommodate the needs.

You may also bring your own interpreter to the event. Please reach out to the SV and Diversity Chairs to set this up.

## Will captions be available?

The conference will be synchronous, and automatically generated closed captions will be provided.

You may also bring your own captioner to the event. Please reach out to the SV and Diversity Chairs to set this up.

## Will there be a chance to try the videoconferencing and other technologies in advance of the conference?

Yes, if you would like early access and an introductory tour of any of the conference technologies, please contact the SV and Diversity Chairs by emailing: <a href="mailto:cui2021-svdiversity@conversationaluserinterfaces.org">cui2021-svdiversity@conversationaluserinterfaces.org</a>

## Can someone assist me with my online participation/presentation?

If you would benefit from assistance in giving your presentation or handling questions, please reach out to the SV and Diversity Chairs to make arrangements.

## Will presenters be visible?

Presenters and speakers will be requested to use video when speaking to help lip-reading and non-native speakers. We recognize that this may not be possible for every speaker. Captions will be available throughout the conference as a fallback.
