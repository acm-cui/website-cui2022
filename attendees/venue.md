        <p>
            The focal point of George Square is one of the city's most iconic and imposing buildings, the City Chambers, whose magnificence tells the story of the wealth and industrial prosperity of the Second City of the Empire. It's one of the most beautiful civic buildings in the UK and a huge favourite amongst locals and tourists. It was opened by Queen Victoria in 1888 and for over a hundred years has been the headquarters of successive city councils. Queen Victoria herself is depicted on the front of the building, with the central apex statue of Truth above her. This figure is known by locals, not surprisingly, as Glasgow's own "Statue of Liberty".
