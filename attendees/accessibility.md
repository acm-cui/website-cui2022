# Accessibility and Diversity

{{ site.conference.short_name }} {{ site.conference.year }} strives to be an inclusive and accessible conference and we will do our best to accommodate requests for special assistance. Information will be posted here as we develop our plans for the conference, to help you make an informed decision about whether the conference will be accessible to you. Please contact us if your question is not answered here, or if the conference arrangements as described are not enough to allow you to attend. We will work with you to the best of our ability, to make the conference accessible.

The {{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles']['accessibility_diversity']['label'] }} is progressively assembling this information. If you have questions or wish to raise a point regarding our efforts to ensure all attendees can participate, please contact us <a href="{{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles']['accessibility_diversity']['email'] }}">by email</a>.

## Pronouns

Per {{ site.conference.short_name }}'s commitment to diversity, inclusion and equity, we wish for all attendees to indicate their pronouns to promote a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment.

Providing/displaying your pronoun on your badge is not mandatory.

Any request after this deadline may be difficult to fulfill depending on the type of request.
